This Final Degree Project (TFG) focuses on the implementation and evaluation of early warning systems (EWS) for predicting financial and banking crises. Various Machine Learning models were analyzed, including Regression Logistic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Perceptron, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The results highlight the importance of capturing nonlinear relationships between economic variables, with the MLP appearing as the most effective model across key metrics. However, it is acknowledged that in certain contexts, simpler models may be preferable due to their interpretability and lower computational requirements. The study also emphasizes the challenge of collecting high-quality data to build robust EWS models and outlines the limitations and opportunities for future research in this field.

Key words: Early Warning Systems (EWS), Banking Crisis Prediction, Machine Learning, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Nonlinear Relationships, Regression Logistic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Economic Indicators (EWI)
